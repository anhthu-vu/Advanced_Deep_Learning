# Advanced_Deep_Learning
This repository contains the programming exercises and projects that I did during the practical sessions of the Advanced Deep Learning (RLD) course in M2A program at Sorbonne Universit√©.

In each source code file, the code between #TODO and #END TODO was written by me, while the other parts are provided.
